## TODO

- [ ] methods for generating synthetic location trajectory. 


- [x]  methods for generating synthetic random graphs


- [x] methods for generating synthetic exampled graphs


- [x] implement Exponential-like Mechanism (ELM)
  - [x] test and verify


- [x] implement Scaled Laplace (S-LM).
  - [x] test and verify


- [x] implement of scaled PIM (S-PIM).
  - [x] test and verify
  - ~~I must study the parameter k of gamma distribution (why k=3?)~~


- [ ] compare runtime between mechanism (ref to 5.2.1)


- [ ] compare utility between mechanism (ref to 5.2.2)
